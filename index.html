<h2>Basketball is a wonderful sport that develops responsiveness, dexterity and coordination of movements in humans. I am very glad that this wonderful game once entered my life. During this time I became more resilient and more confident in myself. In addition, I have made wonderful friends, with whom it is so great to enjoy our victories. For me, basketball is not just a game, it is a separate life, and I love it.</h2>
